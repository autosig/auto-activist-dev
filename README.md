# Auto Activist

## Resources
* The actual automation is performed using code extracted from [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium) and
[Selenium-IDE](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium-ide/tree/v3.17.0) then compiled into `src/js/bot.js`. 
The automation management code written on top of their bot loosely copies a small subset of the selenium node api.
* Used https://github.com/chibat/chrome-extension-typescript-starter for the Chrome Extension starter code.
